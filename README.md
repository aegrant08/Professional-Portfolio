An evolving portfolio used to showcase my budding skills as a web developer. The portfolio has three pages: a landing or about me page, a portfolio page with links to projects on GitHub, and a contact page. On each page there is a footer with icons for GitHub and LinkedIn that are linked to my pages on each site.
