# Application Description

An evolving portfolio used to showcase my budding skills as a web developer. The portfolio has three pages: a landing or about me page, a portfolio page with links to projects on GitHub, and a contact page. On each page there is a footer with icons for GitHub and LinkedIn that are linked to my pages on each site. The navigation bar found at the top of each page has links to the other pages as well as my resume.

The landing page has a photo of me and a small bio about myself.

The portfolio page has six spots to showcase projects I am especially proud of, and four of them are linked to projects on my GitHub.
